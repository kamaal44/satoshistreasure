# Brute force attack against Satoshi's Treasure
Ths is a python script working with wordlists...

Get some wordlist here : http://ftp.icm.edu.pl/

usage :
$ python treasurehunt.py wordlist.txt

If you provide a good list, you 'll get 3 answers for the first 3 keys :)

For a new satoshi key, just edit the script (K1, K2, K3)
