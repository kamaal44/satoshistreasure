# Brute force attack against Satoshi's Treasure

> treasurehunt.py

This is a python script working with wordlists...

Get some wordlist here : http://ftp.icm.edu.pl/

usage :  
$ python treasurehunt.py wordlist.txt

If you provide a good list, you 'll get 3 answers for the first 3 keys :)

For a new satoshi key, just edit the script (K1, K2, K3)


> kkey-crunch-me.py

Use a generator like hashcat, crunch, other and run it for life !

usage :  
$ crunch 1 10 iamover| python kkey-crunch-me.py

For a new satoshi key, just edit the script, add the new one and edit the line 23.

GOOD HUNTING.
